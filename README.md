# Design Engineering Roadmap 2026 🚀

> **Bridging the gap between Design (Figma) and Engineering (Code).**

Welcome to my personal monorepo documenting my 6-month journey to becoming a **Design Engineer**.
Here, I not only write code but also focus on design systems, UI fidelity, and user experience.

## 🎯 My Goal
To build production-ready user interfaces that look exactly like the design and function flawlessly.
**Target Stack:** Figma + React + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript.

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository is organized by weekly sprints, simulating a real-world agile development cycle.

| Sprint | Week | Project | Tech Focus | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S1** | [W01-02](./week01-02-jins-card) | **JINS Product Card** | Semantic HTML, Flexbox/Grid, CSS Variables | ✅ Done |
| **S2** | [W03-04](./week03-04-js-dom-manipulation) | **JINS Product Detail Page** | DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Logic | ✅ Done |
| **S3** | W05-06 | *Loading...* | Advanced UI Patterns & State | ⏳ Pending |

## 🌟 Featured Projects

A pixel-perfect recreation of a product card from the JINS eyewear website.

**🎨 Design (Figma):**
- Mastered **Auto Layout** for responsive spacing.
- Used `Hug` and `Fill` containers to control layout logic.

**💻 Engineering (Code):**
- **Semantic HTML:** Used `<article>`, `<ul>`, and `<button>` instead of generic `<div>`.
- **CSS Tricks:** Implemented `background-clip: content-box` for the double-ring color swatches.
- **Accessibility:** Added `aria-label` to icon-only buttons for screen readers.
